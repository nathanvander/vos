# vos
Personal Productivity App

12/29/2016.  Vos2 has now been released with identical functionality.  This uses the Apollo database wrapper, so the data is stored in
an SQLite database.  This is a very simple project management tool, with time tracking, scheduling, and to do items.  Obviously it needs
improvement, but it works.

1/3/2016.  Release Version 2.1.  The big differences are added fields for Matter and Activity, and using the weasel.Webobject interface for reports, so they can be viewed in a browser.
